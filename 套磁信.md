Dear Dr. Filip Ginter

 
My name is Weikang Wang. I come from Zhejiang Province, China. I am currently a 3rd year postgraduate in Beijing Language and Culture University. I major in computer science. During my studies, I have been focusing on the natural language processing program, supervised by Dr. Liu Pengyuan.I got your contact information from your paper. I am writing to consult whether at present or in the near future that you recruit doctoral candidates in 2021 .

Previously, I have examined the domain adaptation for punctuation prediction in Mandarin. And I released our thesis entitled A Multi-domain Punctuation Prediction Benchmark at CCL (The Nineteenth China National Conference on Computational Linguistics)（abstract attachment 2）. At present, I am working on the study of unsupervised domain adaptation for punctuation prediction based on previous dataset. I am very interested in your study about cross-lingul and Biomedical Natural Language Processing.
And it. And I wish I could study corss-domain and corss-lingual with you during the  Doctor Degree.

I have worked as a nlp intern in the text analysis group at Ping An Technology for 5 months (2020 4.7 – 2020 9.6). I was primarily in charge of completing the semi-automatic construction of the Buddhistic QA base, and constructing the baseline of FAQ for Buddhism.

I am attaching you a copy of my CV for your reference. I really wish to work with you. Look forward to discussing my application with you in details. I can be reached at 86-157-2060-7036 or via email at wangweikang0508@gmail.com . Thank you very much for your time and consideration.      



Best wishes,
Weikang Wang
